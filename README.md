# Custom Web Components Directory

Welcome to my custom Web Components. This is something that I do for fun, please don't use them in any actual production setting!

## How to use bjeck components

1. Copy the whole build folder into your projects
2. To use the component justlink to it using a script tag

example
```html
<script src="<your-folder>/build/<component-name>.js"></script>
```

You can now use a bjeck component as a normal HTML tag in your project!
